			record methods.(<a href="examples.html">check the examples</a>)</li>
			<li>The FieldQuoted attribute was completely rewritten to support
			optional quote for read, write or both. <br/>

		<p>Now the important things !!... <a href="runtime_classes.html"><b>RunTime Records</b></a>
		are here thanks to some help Gerhardt Scriven to use RunTime Compilation. Enjoy it !!</p>

		<p><b>I think in this version as 2.0 </b> because the RunTime Records functionalities were
		one of the most requested features and also one of the hardest to implement features.
		A lot of effort was put into usability and a clear API, if you have any suggestion please post it in the forums =)<br/>
		Other important news are the <a href="FileHelpers.CsvEngine.html">CsvEngine</a> (for generic CSV files),
		the <a href="example_filediffengine.html">FileDiffEngine</a>,
		the <a href="example_multirecords.html">MultiRecordEngine</a>,..</p>

			Supports for classes written in C# and VB.NET<br/>
			There are a lot of features inside this new feature, <a href="runtime_classes.html">so take a look at the docs</a></li>
			<li>MOD: The <strong>Record wizard</strong> was completely rewritten to use the run time records 
			and now has a lot of options to check the classes that you are 
			building, in the future the wizard could help you discovering the 
			record class based on a sample file</li>
			<li>ADD: Generic CSV files are now supported (for example Excel generated ones)<br/>
			Was a hard work but worth it because it can be used with any engine. <br/>
			In the next version I'll add the Excellent
			<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/CsvReader.aspx">Fast CSV Reader</a>
			from <b>Sébastien Lorion</b> for standalone CSV processing.</li>

			<p>The library has passed its 1st birthday !!! and thanks to the work and
			contribution of a lot of people (<a href="credits.html">partial list of  them)</a></p>
			<p>Too many things were changed, mostly internally, now we have a performance gain of
			more than 60% in .NET 2.0</p>
			<p>I will be releasing the version for .NET 1.1 because I know that a lot of people use
			it in some corporations, but maybe in the next releases the new features will be .net
			2.0 only.  It's a massive job maintain and optimize both =( versions</p>
			<p>There are also a lot of major changes, refactoring in the code, and a big
			core rewrite that allow the engines to use less memory and temporary string (we
			are using more buffers to avoid this)</p>
			<p>We were very busy to keep to library updated and to give support to the users.
			Check the forums for any problems as it's likely they have been addressed here.</p>
			<p>We have our own domain www.filehelpers.com thanks to (Antoine) and a DevBlog
			at http://blog.filehelpers.com</p>
		</div>

		<p>Here do you have all the stuff that keep me busy for a while :P</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Breaking Changes
			<ul>
				<li>The constructor of the MultiRecordEngine was changed to allow params args,
				and to allow users to not pass the RecordSelector (in write operations where it was not needed).</li>
				<li>EndsRead and EndsWrite deleted, now you have a Close() operation
				to simplify the API and to make it similar to the System.Data namespace. (The async engines also implement IDisposable)</li>
				<li>Rename FileHelperException --&gt; FileHelpers Exception a better
				name =) and an easy to solve problem</li>
				<li>By default the numeric fields in the FixedLengthRecords that don't
				have an [FieldAlign] will be aligned to the right and the rest the left by default,
				with this we avoid the problem of generate files with different meaning when
				reading and writing</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Performance related
			<ul>
				<li>Internal use of Reflection.Emit, Dynamic Methods and char buffers to get <strong>
				more than 50% enhancement in performance and for .NET 2.0 more than 65%</strong></li>
				<li>The Read..AsDT methods now creates the DataTable record by record,
				not at the end, so you can handle large files without any memory overload</li>
				<li>No more reflection in the operations (only in the constructors).</li> 
				<li>FieldSorter faster too, Removed REFLECTION for EMIT</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Shining new features
			<ul>
				<li>The very cool <a href="example_delimitedengine.html">DelimitedFileEngine</a> and
				<a href="example_fixedengine.html">FixedFileEngine</a> that allow to change options at
				RunTime (also with generic versions) <a href="example_generics.html">Check an example here</a></li>
				<li><a href="example_conditionalrecords.html">ConditionalRecords</a> you can easily include
				or exclude certain records based on a RecordCondition (like BeginsWith, EndsWith,
				Contains or RegEx) <a href="example_conditionalrecords.html">Check the example</a></li>
				<li>A new GenericDatabaseStorage to allow databases use ADO.NET to work with the
				FileHelpers (Thanks Rodolfo Finochietti)</li>
				<li>Experimental <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono project</a> Support (some users
				are already using it, we hope that in the next release we have a completely working version
				for this framework)</li>
				<li>New version checker in the demos and wizard (both with a renewed look and feel)
				<a href="http://www.filehelpers.com/movies.html">Check the movies</a></li>
				<li>.NET 2.0 Nullable Types support. (Thanks Vijayan)
				<a href="example_nullable.html">Check the example</a></li>
				<li>Notification Interfaces: you can now get notified of the events simply implement them</li>
				<li>Enhanced Debugging in .NET 2.0 with DebuggerDisplay and DebuggerBrowsable,
				DebugVisualizars to come.</li>
				<li>The wizard has a record class test that allows you to introduce sample data and
				your class and check for errors or results.</li>
				<li>You can <a href="http://www.filehelpers.com/movies.html">check our screencasts</a>
				for the demos, wizard and other features of the library.</li>
				<li>Now the code for Vs2003 and Vs2005 are both on SVN, sharing the same files and the
				build script autodetect your Visual Studio installation. So no more excuses time to get involved =)</li>
				<li>The engines with asynchronous operations are now IDisposable and IEnumerable so you can
				declare it with using(..) and use them in a foreach loop </li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>API changes and extensions
			<ul>
				<li>The write methods are less strict.  You can pass now an IEnumerable instead of an
				array, so you can directly pass a List or ArrayList to the method without doing a ToArray()</li>
				<li>RunTime records can now get a DataTable in the constructor and use DataColumns
				to create one field for each column.</li> 
				<li>Generic versions of near all the engines of the library (it is really hard to
				maintain the two copies :P so everyone it is time to port !!)</li>
				<li>Asynchronous operations in others engines like the MultiRecordEngine</li> 
				<li>Event support to the MultiRecordEngine thanks to the contribution of Francis de Fouchier</li>
				<li>The library now handles infinite levels of inheritance adding the high level
				fields first in the result record class.</li>
				<li>Allow to ignore spaces and tabs in the
				<a href="FileHelpers.IgnoreEmptyLinesAttribute.html">IgnoreEmptyLinesAttribute</a></li>
				<li><a href="FileHelpers.IgnoreCommentedLinesAttribute.html">IgnoreCommentedLines</a> thanks to MCampbell</li>
				<li>The Read methods now have a maxRecords args to tell to the engines how much them must read.</li>
				<li>A new constructor overload to the engine that allow to pass the Encoding. This is
				useful to make the users aware of the Encoding feature.</li>
				<li>FileTransformEngine with two new methods ReadAndTransformRecords and TransformRecords</li>
				<li>Flush method to AsyncEngines to allow users to ensure data is written.
				For example, if they are using the library for logging.</li>
				<li>The converters are now smarter as they validate to which types can be assigned
				and throw exceptions if converter is wrong (for example if you use
				ConverterKind.Decimal in a int field)</li>
				<li>The <a href="FileHelpers.ConvertException.html">ConvertException</a> has a lot of
				context information: LineNumber, ColumnNumber, FieldName.  Also better exception messages.</li>
				<li>The integer converters receive now take a decimal separator to build an InvariantCulture
				to format and parse the values and strings</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Small changes
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed the problem with ASP.NET: "Line 0: Metadata file
				'filehelpers.dll' could not be found"</li>
				<li>Fixed some problems with the CsvClassBuilder (it is a good
				practice to not to release the last minute added features)</li>
				<li>The assemblies are now signed</li>
				<li>The new ConverterBase.DefaultDateTimeFormat to avoid set the
				converter format field by field =)</li>
				<li>Some error messages from the library were rewritten and now provides
				more contextual information (line and column numbers, field name, etc).</li>
				<li>ExcelStorage supports more than 26 columns (thanks to Mark Izendooren)</li>
				<li>Encoding support to the CsvEngine</li>
				<li>The wizard remembers all the paths now</li>
				<li>SkipThisRecord in the AfterReadRecordEventArgs, this allows engine
				to skip records from the results (thanks Crestline)</li>
				<li>More methods for the <a href="FileHelpers.CommonEngineMembers.html">CommonEngine</a></li>
				<li>More than <a href="testing.html">420+ NUnit tests</a>
				!!! (I cant believe it, I'm a lazy developer but I know how much value you get out of testing the library)</li>
				<li>You now have two versions for the demos, one for each framework version.</li>
				<li>The FixedLengthClassBuilder has more constructors to set the length of the fields in your instruction</li>
				<li>Improved documentation. (Thanks Antoine and Matt)</li>
				<li><a href="examples.html">A lot of new examples check it out !!</a> </li>

			<p>Hi everyone again !!</p>
			<p>The FileHelpers has reached a big Milestone today<br/>
		we are releasing the <b>3.0 version!</b><br/> With full support
			for <b>.NET 4.0</b> and with a ton of news and enhancements<br/><br/>
			After some time off for differents reasons we are now trying to update the library in a more regular fasion :)
			</p>

			<li><b>Main changes</b>
			<ul>
				<li>The core code of the library was refactored to make easier to extend it</li>
				<li>Better performance, mostly for FixedLenght records</li>
				<li>The error messages have been made more meaningful.  In all exceptions you get; the FieldName, ColumnNumber, LineNumber, etc.</li>
				<li>Docs rewritten thanks to the work of Ken Foskey</li>
				<li>CHANGED: Removed support for </li>
				<li>CHANGED: Better caching of internal classes</li>
				<li>NEW: Full .NET 2.0 & 4.0 support</li>
				<li>NEW: FieldOrder: a new attribute to override the default order of fields</li>
				<li>NEW: Async Methods returns IDisposable to allow using() statements that autoclose files on ends or exception</li>
				<li>NEW: ReadFileAsList: new methods to directly get a List<T> instead of an array</li>
				<li>NEW: Events for the Async engines</li>
				<li>NEW: The events args now have TotalBytes and CurrentBytes to allow you show progress while reading or writting</li>
				<li>NEW: FieldIndexers you can now get the values in the AsyncEngine like in the DataReader of ADO.NET =)
				You can access them via index or fieldName (at the moment case sensitive)<br />
				This also completes the RunTime records support</li>
				<li>NEW: FormatDetector: A class designed to discover the format of delimited and flat files based on sample files. It is integrated with the wizzard</li>
				<li>NEW: Better Delited validations to make sure that the file contains the right number of fields</li>
				<li>NEW: FieldValueDiscarted: a new attribute to allow the value of a particular field to be read but not stored in the record class (this was a very requested feature)</li>			
				<li>NEW: BigFileSorter: if you need to sort big files, you can use this feature that implements External Sorting </li>
